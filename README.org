* SYS.02.02 Automate Meta WIP Category
** Project Overview
This project aims to develop a Python-based automation system for the *SYS.02.02 Meta WIP Category.* The system will help manage, prioritize, and optimize active projects based on various factors and daily conditions.
We will follow @simonw's *perfect commit* strategy, emphasizing test-driven development (TDD) and continuous documentation throughout the process.
** Goals
1. *Develop* a script to automate project sorting and prioritization
2. *Implement* a daily optimization routine
3. *Create* a standardized project README structure with frontmatter
4. *Integrate* with an LLM for context-aware project suggestions
5. *Implement* file organization and syncing between SYS.02.00 (Meta WIP Capture) and project-specific directories
6. *Ensure* comprehensive test coverage and up-to-date documentation

** Development Strategy
We will follow @simonw's *perfect commit* strategy, which emphasizes small, focused commits that include both tests and documentation. Each feature or change will be developed using the following steps:
1. Write a *failing test* for the new feature or change
2. Implement the *minimum code necessary* to make the test pass
3. *Refactor the code* if needed, ensuring tests still pass
4. Update or add *relevant documentation*
5. Commit the changes with a *clear, descriptive message*
This approach ensures that our project maintains high test coverage and up-to-date documentation throughout the development process.
